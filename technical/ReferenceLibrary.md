# Reference Library

The FPA maintains a small reference library that is available to contributors.

Current Holdings:
    - ASME Y14_3_2012_R2018 - Orthographic and pictorial views
    - ISO 128-3_2022 - Technical product documentation part 3

To borrow a volume from the library send a message to fpa@freecad.org. If the volume is available,
you will be given access instructions.

To have a required volume added to the reference library, submit a request specifying the volume,
price and vendor to fpa@freecad.org.  You should also include a brief summary of why the volume is
required.  The FPA will evaluate the request and, if funds are available, the volume will be 
purchased and added to the library.

Note that many reference works have limitations on copying and concurrent usage.  For example, ISO
Standards are restricted to a single user and copying is prohibited.  Please respect these limitations.
