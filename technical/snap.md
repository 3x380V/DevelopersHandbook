# Maintaining the Snap package

FreeCAD is provided as a Snap package in multiple versions:
  * stable -- built from the latest full release
  * beta -- built weekly from master
  * edge -- built daily from master
  * freecad-realthunder -- a convenience build of the LinkStage3 branch

Each of these is represented by a branch at https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-snap -- to make changes, switch to the appropriate branch.
